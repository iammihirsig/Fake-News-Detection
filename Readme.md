## About

This project is a **Fake News Detection System** that uses **Logistic Regression** to classify news articles as **Fake or Real**. The model is trained on a dataset of true and fake news articles and deployed using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface.

## Features

- âœ… User-friendly **Streamlit** interface
- âœ… Detects fake news using **Logistic Regression**
- âœ… Text preprocessing: **TF-IDF Vectorization, Stopword Removal, Stemming**
- âœ… **Accuracy**: 99% on test data
- âœ… Deployed for live testing

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (First Python project ðŸŽ‰)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression
- **NLP**: TF-IDF Vectorizer, Regular Expressions
- **Frontend**: Streamlit, HTML, CSS
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud

## Model Performance

| Metric        | Score       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Accuracy      | **99%**     |
| Precision     | **98.5%**   |
| Recall        | **98.5%**   |
| F1 Score      | **99%**     |
| Training Time | **~30 sec** |

## What I Learned

This was my **first Python project**, and I learned:

- **Data preprocessing** techniques for NLP
- **Building and training** an ML model
- **Deploying** a Streamlit app
- **Version control** with GitHub

## Getting Started
